<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>hdfs://rr1</value>
  <description>
         Formerly fs.default.name, the default path prefix used by the Hadoop FS client when
         none is given. 
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.journalnode.edits.dir</name>
  <value>/var/lib/hdfs/journal</value>
  <description>
         Configure the addresses of the JournalNodes which provide the shared edits storage,
         written to by the Active NameNode and read by the Standby NameNode to stay
         up-to-date with all the file system changes the Active NameNode makes. Though you
         must specify several JournalNode addresses, you should only configure one of
         these URIs.

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.fencing.methods</name>
  <value>sshfence(root:2122)
         shell(/bin/true)
  </value>
  <description>
         It is critical for correctness of the system that only one NameNode is
         in the Active state at any given time. Thus, during a failover, the
         haadmin command first ensures that the Active NameNode is either in the
         Standby state, or that the Active NameNode process has terminated, before
         haadmin transitions the other NameNode to the Active state. The method
         that haadmin uses to ensure this is called the fencing method.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.private-key-files</name>
  <value>/root/.ssh/id_rsa</value>
  <description>
         SSH fence simply SSH-es to the Active NameNode to kill the process.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.quorum</name>
  <value>phlrrinfra01:2181,phlrrinfra02:2181,phlrrinfra03:2181,phlrrinfra04:2181,phlrrinfra05:2181</value>
  <description>
         The list the host-port pairs running the ZooKeeper service ZKFailoverController.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.trash.interval</name>
  <value>4320</value>
  <description>
         The number of minutes after which a trash checkpoint directory is deleted.
         This option can be configured both on the server and the client.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.trash.checkpoint.interval</name>
  <value>60</value>
  <description>
         The number of minutes between trash checkpoints. Every time the checkpointer
         runs on the NameNode, it creates a new checkpoint of the "Current" directory
         and removes checkpoints older than fs.trash.interval minutes. This value
         should be smaller than or equal to fs.trash.interval. This option is configured
         on the server. If configured to zero (the default), then the value is set to
         the value of fs.trash.interval.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.proxyuser.root.groups</name>
  <value>*</value>
  <description>
         The 'nfsserver' user is allowed to proxy all members of the 'users-group1' and
         'users-group2' groups. Note that in most cases you will need to include the
         group "root" because the user "root" (which usually belonges to "root" group) will
         generally be the user that initially executes the mount on the NFS client system.
         Set this to '*' to allow nfsserver user to proxy any group.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.proxyuser.root.hosts</name>
  <value>*</value>
  <description>
         This is the host where the nfs gateway is running. Set this to '*' to allow
         requests from any hosts to be proxied.
